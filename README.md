### Notes

I liked this project. Not only was the design simple, but the code itself with it was fairly simple as well. Like other front-end challenges, I've been given a couple PSDs and told to make a single page site.

One of the major challenges for this one was to create a mobile-friendly approach without using Bootstrap or Foundation. I ended up creating a grid system anyway because it's a *great* system, but I tried to make it more Foundation-ey vs. Bootstrap-ey. Even though I've never directly worked with Foundation (as of this point), based on what I've heard it's cleaner. The HTML markup was simple and the Javascript was clean as well.

This project was completed in less than two days and it resulted in an interview. I was told that only 10% or so are asked to do an assessment and of them, only 10% are asked for an interview from that assessment. I was excited to get into that 1%, but nevertheless, it didn't result in a hire. Oh well.
